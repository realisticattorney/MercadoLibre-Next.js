# MercadoLibre Next

A MercadoLibre's e-commerce app clone, perhaps the only one on the web, built using Next.js, Stripe, Firebase, MercadoLibre's API, TailwindCSS, NextAuth and more. Go  any of the categories on the homepage you'll be server with a product's feed that it's pre-fetched each 60 seconds from MercadoLibre's API. Clicking on the categories found on the dropdown menus will serve the page fetch just in time. Either way, you can add products to your cart, go to checkout and pay for them through Stripe
