# MercadoLibre Next

A MercadoLibre's e-commerce app clone, perhaps the only one on the web. It's fetches the latest products from MercadoLibre's API and displays them just like the original app. I've included the dropdown menus 


I've built it using Next.js, Firebase, Stripe & TailwindCSS, among others.
