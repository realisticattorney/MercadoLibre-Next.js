# MercadoLibre Next

A MercadoLibre's e-commerce app clone, perhaps the only one on the web, built using Next.js, Stripe, Firebase, MercadoLibre's API, TailwindCSS, NextAuth and more. Click on any of category on the homepage and you'll be served instantly with products that are pre-fetched each 60 seconds from MercadoLibre's API (ISR). For the categories found on the dropdown menus at the navigation bar, will served fetching those products just in time (SSR). Either way, you can add products to your cart, go to checkout and pay for them through Stripe. Down below I'll give more details of how.
